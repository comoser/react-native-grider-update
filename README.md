# Attention

This is not a new project, this is simply an updated version of the Manager App from Stephen Grider's course "The Complete React Native and Redux Course".

This project implements `react-navigation v1.0.0-beta.11` (https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) instead of `react-native-redux-router` (https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-redux-router)

This is due to this navigation method being referenced in the official react-native docs here: (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html)
