# Attention

This is not a new project, this is simply an updated version of the Manager App from Stephen Grider's course "The Complete React Native and Redux Course".

This project implements `react-navigation v1.0.0-beta.11` (https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) instead of `react-native-redux-router` (https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-redux-router)

This is due to this navigation method being referenced in the official react-native docs here: (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html)

# Changes

This version of the "Manager App" is now at the state of the App Stephen makes at the end of the course.

It implements FlatList instead of the ListView, it implements the react-navigation package and in the Edit/Create employee section, I took a different approach than the one Stephen takes, but it works just the same.
